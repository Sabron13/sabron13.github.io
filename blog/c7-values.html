    <p>Tranquility is important to me because I've lived alone for 5 years now and I'm used to working in silence. I turn off everything and zone in on what I'm doing. I've tried working with music on, but it just distracts me. Not only is it important for my environment, but for my mind as well. I have an active imagination and tend to worry a lot and left unchecked it can snowball. So keeping calm, especially with the amount of stress I'm about to be under will be very important for me.

    <p>When I think about my values I acheive a degree of inner tranquility. It's this kind of system that I need to combat snowballing stress. A system where the more I think about and value my values, the more I can achieve and incorporate them in myself. I think it could help to stem the tide of stereotype threat as it reinforces what you are really about and not what people think you are about. Most importantly it reaffirms it for yourself. Others may not change your opinion of you, but you won't let that make you become something that you are not.
      
    </p>
    <p>Besides thinking about values, I plan on bringing a number of books that I have found inspirational through the years like <i>The 50th Law</i> and <i>The Tools</i> along with others. Rereading those words gives a piece of that tranquility that I search for daily.
