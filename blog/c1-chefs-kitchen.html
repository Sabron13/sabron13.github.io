      From the video Shereef seems like a very smart and caring guy which are two great qualities for a teacher, or principal?, to have. I get the feeling that I will be surrounded with similarly like-minded teachers, which is great for us students.

      Shereef mentioned that there are two kinds of mindsets students can assume. One, being the restaurant mindset where the DBC experience can seem commercial and transactional. To me that seems like a more hands-off approach from a student's perspective, a more passive way to learn. Shereef stressed taking on a kitchen mentality with the rolling-up of sleeves and getting your hands dirty, making a mess. This is thrilling for me because I'm typically the restaurant type. So having people to help push me into kitchen mode, and rising to that challenge sounds awesome! And a little nerve racking.

      He also mentioned a couple fears that students have coming into Dev bootcamp. The first being that it was a mistake that you were accepted. The imposter syndrome. The other being the thought that you are too far advanced for DBC and you will be held back by your classmates and teachers. I definitely fall into the first camp. I have zero coding background and I didn't think I did particularly well in my interview, yet here I am! So I look forward to getting over that fear using some of your more atypical techniques like mindfulness training and yoga.
