    <h1>Version Control & git</h1>
    <h4>12-31-2014</h4>
      <p>
      My girlfriend, Jen, plays the violin in a band. She complains that while rehearsing she'll improvise something she really likes, and then it's gone, wiped from her memory and never to be reproduced again. But, if they had been recording their session, a new version of the song would exist with her improvised part. This is the essence of version control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Version control is like creating checkpoints along the way while you're creating something. If the band practiced a song a bunch of times, they would have multiple recordings at hand. They could cut and edit the songs in numerous ways to make even more versions of the song. They would simply save each version they liked with their software. In developing, git is that software.
    </p>
    <p>
      Git is a tool developers use to implement version control. With a simple status check from git you can see all the files you have modified. Decide against a change? Git will allow you to make some changes permanent, while not making others so. And even when the changes are permanent, places like GitHub keep a log of all the changes you've made; what you've added, what's been deleted, etc. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Say Jen's band mates were living half way around the world in Korea (two of them are, no for real!), and both sides want to work on a song they wrote. Well, a master copy posted online would be handy. That's GitHub: a place online to keep your collaborative work. Like I already said, it keeps a log of all changes so you can revert back to a previous working version should need be. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      So what did we learn? Version control is creating and saving different versions of your work like checkpoints. Git is used to do this and has many amazing features. And GitHub is a place that hosts your work.

      <h2>Kitchen v. Restaurant</h2>
    <h4>1-1-2015</h4> 
    <p>
      From the video Shereef seems like a very smart and caring guy which are two great qualities for a teacher, or principal?, to have. I get the feeling that I will be surrounded with similarly like-minded teachers, which is great for us students.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shereef mentioned that there are two kinds of mindsets students can assume. One, being the restaurant mindset where the DBC experience can seem commercial and transactional. To me that seems like a more hands-off approach from a student's perspective, a more passive way to learn. Shereef stressed taking on a kitchen mentality with the rolling-up of sleeves and getting your hands dirty, making a mess. This is thrilling for me because I'm typically the restaurant type. So having people to help push me into kitchen mode, and rising to that challenge sounds awesome! And a little nerve racking.
    </p>

      He also mentioned a couple fears that students have coming into Dev bootcamp. The first being that it was a mistake that you were accepted. The imposter syndrome. The other being the thought that you are too far advanced for DBC and you will be held back by your classmates and teachers. I definitely fall into the first camp. I have zero coding background and I didn't think I did particularly well in my interview, yet here I am! So I look forward to getting over that fear using some of your more atypical techniques like mindfulness training and yoga.
