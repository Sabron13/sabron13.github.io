    <p>Positioning your html with CSS may be the trickiest part. Anybody can change a font or make a header, but can you arrange the items on a screen (taking into account the many types of screens and different browsers out there) so everything can be seen? Without any overlapping text boxes or pics? Or Everything garbled up in the top left corner? Well that is what I'm here to talk about; the difference between absolute, relative, and fixed positioning.

    <p>Relative positioning means a block of content is displayed relative to itself. So if no parameters are entered, it would appear where it normally would, and any parameters you enter will move the block relative to this position.

    </p>
    
    <p>Absolute positioning means a block is positioned relative to the next parent element's position as long as the parent is either relatively or absolutely positioned itself. The trick with absolute positioning is that once pinned where you want it, it will not be affected or affect any other element on the page. So it stands the chance that some content may overlap it. Something to remember before you absolutely position everything.

    <p>Fixed positioning is like putting a post-it note on your computer screen. Where ever you go, that post-it is taking up its space. So on a site, no matter where you scroll, the fixed element stays in it's position. This is most commonly used with <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/menus.en.html">navigation bars</a> (at the right).
