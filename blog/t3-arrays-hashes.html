    <p>Arrays and hashes are collections of objects in ruby. The main difference between them is how they are indexed. In arrays the objects can be
      called by using an integer:
      <pre class="prettyprint"><code>
        arr = [1, 2, 3]
        arr[0]
        => 1
      </code></pre>

      While elements of a hash are called by a predetermined key provided by the programmer:
      <pre class="prettyprint"><code>  
        hash = { 
          :food => "taco"
          :drink => "horchata"
          :desert => "flan"
          }
        hash[:dessert]
        => "flan"
      </code></pre>
    </p>
    
    <p>Other than that, the main differences are one's of syntax. When creating an array we use brackets:
      <pre class="prettypring lang-ruby"> 
        []
      </pre>
      When creating or denoting a hash we use braces:
      <pre class="prettypring lang-ruby">  
        {}
      </pre>
        
    </p>
