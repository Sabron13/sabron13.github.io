  <h1 id="heading">JavaScript vs Ruby- Looping</h1>
  

  <section>
    <h2>2-8-2015</h2>
    
    <p>Looping in programming is a way to tell a computer to repeat a task until a certain condition is met. If the condition is
      not met, however, the computer will go on and on with it's task for forever, or at least its battery life, or if it is plugged in
      until the processor burns up, or until you interrupt it with a command. The point is, it probably won't go on forever, but
      would if it had the capability.
    </p>
    
    <p>Both Ruby and JavaScript both utilize looping and at first glance they can look very similar.
    </p>
    
    <p><pre class="prettyprint"><code>
        while x < 10
          x += 1
        end</code></pre>

      <pre class="prettyprint"><code>
        while (x < 10) {
          x += 1
        }</code></pre>
    </p>
    
    <p>Here we have a Ruby while loop at the top and a JavaScript loop at the bottom. Just from previously knowing Ruby, the JavaScript syntax
      is pretty easy to understand, but there are a couple subtle differences. In JS the expression after the <em>while</em> keyword is put in parentheses
      and then followed by an opening curly brace <i>{</i>. Then the code block in the middle is the same, but Ruby closes its loop with keyword
      <em>end</em> while JS closes its block with closing curly brace <i>}</i>, which are functionally the same, they both end the while statement.
      In Ruby the curly braces mean the same as the keywords <em>do</em> and <em>end</em>, and the code block could be opened with <em>do</em>, but 
      is omitted for brevity's sake. So overall pretty similar.
    </p>
    
    <p>The for loop is where we see the biggest difference. In Ruby the for loop is used to iterate through a group of things, usually an array. In JS
      for loops are used the same as while loops with a counter.
    </p>

    <p><pre class="prettyprint"><code>
      for x in array
        puts x + 1
      end</code></pre>

      <pre class="prettyprint"><code>
      var x = 0;
      for (var counter = 0; counter < 10; counter++)
        console.log(x + 1);</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>Here we see two totally different looking codes except for the mathematical expression x + 1. We even see some new notation we haven't seen in Ruby. The Ruby code at the top
      is a very short program that adds 1 to all the elements in <em>array</em>. In the bottom JS code we see that x is a stand alone variable set to 0 and
      the for loop creates a counter set to 0 and means to increment up 9 by 1 (the funny counter++ means the same as counter += 1). So in the end our output is the number the number one 10 times. Two things with the same name, but totally different outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>Besides the for and while Ruby has a host of other keywords to iterate through things. It has <em>unless</em>, <em>until</em>, <em>loop</em>, <em>redo</em> and <em>retry</em> to name a few. For JS the for and while loops are pretty much it, except for <em>do</em>.
