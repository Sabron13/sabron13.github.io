    <p>Have you ever been afraid to confirm what you think people think about you? When you believe people there is a risk that people
      stereotype you, that is Stereotype Threat. It isn't a pleasant feeling to be stereotyped, but even worse is when it is through
      your own actions that you confirm a stereotype. 
    </p>
    
    <p>I am from a small city in Indiana called New Haven. What's interesting about New Haven is that it is the closest city near Fort Wayne,
      Indiana's second largest city. While Fort Wayne is certainly not as metropolitan as New York, to a guy from New Haven, it can feel like that
      at times. In Fort Wayne there are more of many things that large cities have. There is more wealth, more arts, and more sophistication than in New Haven. One thing for sure that Fort Wayne has more of is diversity, while New Haven has a reputation as being less racially tolerant.

    <p>I used to work in a meat market in New Haven where I would guess at least 95% of our customers were white, the other 5% being mostly black. Within that 5% were a handful of repeat customers who I would come to recognize. While I was always friendly and courteous I could never get over the underlying tension I felt while waiting on them, even with repeat customers that I knew better than an absolute stranger. Even writing this now I can fee the tension creep in, making me choose my words carefully and complete my thoughts before I start typing. 
    </p>
    
    <p>The tension came from not wanting to confirm the stereotype of white people in New Haven. And just like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fzIuuXlkk">experiment Dr. Steele described in his speech at Columbia</a> (@ 31:31), I could feel myself wanting to put more distance between us, not because I didn't want to be around them, but because I was afraid I would do or say something to confirm that stereotype. Being more racially tolerant is a trait that I value in myself and I didn't want to put that piece of me in jeoparody, which is sadly ironic.
    </p>
    
    <p>The best thing I can do when I feel stereotype threat is to remember to not take myself too seriously. When I do that I experience the kind of performance anxiety Dr. Steele described in his other experiments that throws people off their game. So just by remembering to relax and have fun, and by being aware that stereotype threat exists, I can curb performance anxiety. As for helping others experiencing stereotype threat I can commiserate with them.
