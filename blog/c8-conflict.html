    <h2>2-14-2015</h2>
    <p>I used to work at an old fashioned meat market where customers would pick out what they wanted from the display case and we would weigh it and wrap it up for them. Yeah, just like Sam the butcher from the Brady Bunch. There were basically two main jobs there: Waiting on customers and cutting meat. I was in the position where I split time almost equally between the two jobs, then there was a coworker, Gabby, who spent most of her time waiting on customers. Well, that's how it would go theoretically. In reality, Gabby had a third job, talking to customers. We had a lot of repeat customers that Gabby would get to know real well and whenever they came in she would spend some time catching up.
    </p>
    
    <p>This drove me crazy to no end. I would be trying to fulfill the other half of my duties while constantly being interrupted to wait on customers that Gabby could have waited on had she not been talking. I would be seething with anger while trying to be courteous through clenched teeth to customers; not a good combination. I never confronted Gabby about it though. Instead I dealt with it passive-aggressively. I would be short with her, argue with her over other things, and act put out whenever she asked for help.
    </p>
    
    <p>Finally I realized that I was harming myself as much as I was harming her. Reading that I realize how selfish I was. I couldn't stop being a jerk because I was hurting her, I could only stop because the anger was consuming me. But that's the way it was. In order to stop I had to change the way I thought about the situation. My boss never did anything to stop Gabby from gabbing. He thought it was good customer relations. Why did we have so many repeat customers? Partly because Gabby was great at customer service. And honestly, I really didn't like to wait on customers (and I wasn't that great at it either). So rationalizing that Gabby should be waiting on more customers and talking less was just a way of thinking that would serve me. She waits on more, I wait on less, I win.
    </p>
    
    <p>If I could go back I would try to be more like Gabby. She was and still is great at her job. As an introvert I have a hard time connecting with people at times. I could have used the practice of stepping out of my shell more. Also, I would be direct about it. I wouldn't ask her to stop talking to customers completely, but talk less when there are other customers that need to be waited on. 
    </p>
    
    <p>In the end, I learned that when angry my mind can play tricks on me. It can convince me I'm in the right, when really I am not. It can rationalize things that are irrational. An angry mind is not to be trusted, unless it's a righteous anger.
