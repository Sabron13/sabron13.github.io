    <h2>2-1-2015</h2>
    <p>We spent this last week learning about classes in Ruby and all their working pieces like instance variables, attribute methods, and instance methods. Now comes class's cousin: the <i>Module</i>. Modules are groupings of methods and constants, much the way classes are, but unlike classes you can't create an instance of a module. No, in order to access all the cool toys a module has to offer you have to <i>include</i> it in a class. This inclusion is called a mix-in. You use the keyword "include" and your module's name.
     </p>

      <pre class="prettyprint"><code>
        module Module
          # methods and constants go here
        end

        class Class
          include Module
        end
      </code></pre>
      
      
    

    <p>Notice how the module name "Module" is capitalized the same way the class name "Class" is. Much like classes are meant to have only a single responsibility, modules are meant to be organized collections of methods and constants that can be plugged into a class to round out its instances' capabilities. A module will contain some of the behaviors, but not all. Usually modules come about by developers trying to keep it D.R.Y. For instance, say a high school science class wants to write a program to determine the rate precipitation falls. They create a Gravity constant to aid this end, but looking ahead the teacher sees the potato gun challenge where he wants students to calculate a potatos hangtime. He sees that the Gravity constant would be useful then too. So instead of stowing the constant in the Precipitation class he creates a module called gravity to store it in. He puts the Gravity module in separate file in the same directory, so now how does he access it. He <i>requires</i> it from the file.

      <pre class="prettyprint"><code>
        require "filename.goeshere"

        class Precipitation
          include Gravity

          # methods go here

        end
      </code></pre>
      
    </p>

    <p>Another difference between modules and classes is classes can only inherit from one superclass, whereas modules can be reused as much as you like. Also common practice is to name classes as nouns and modules as adjectives, afterall classes create objects which are nouns and modules carry a portion of the stuff that makes the object like itself.
