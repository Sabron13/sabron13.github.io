    <p>My score from the Gregoric style of thinking was a tie. A tie? Yup, 36 and 36. Well that's interesting. But wait it gets better. The categories that tied were Concrete Sequential and Abstract Random, two seemingly opposite styles of thinking. A CS thinker finds it difficult to work in groups, while the AR thinker thrives in group activities. The AR thinker finds it difficult to work in a restrictive environment while the CS thinker thrives on order, structure and predictability. The CS thinker has problems "dealing with <em>abstract</em> ideas."  And the AR thinker has difficulty "giving exact details." Faced with this information I wondered if I might have a learning disability.

    <p>All joking aside, I do see parts of myself reflected in each group. I like order and logic, but I have problems concentrating on one thing at a time. When building my website I was constantly getting distracted by the newest problem and found it hard to stay focused on one task. And I do like to work with people, but only within the right environment. If the vibe is too cold, or formal, I'd rather work alone. Not that I hate formalities though, I often rely on them in social situations. But at the same time I find them boring and repetitive.

    <p>I think what this says about my learning style is that I behave differently in different environments. I think in an ideal social learning situation where I am comfortable I tend to be a more abstract random learner. But when uncomfortable I tend to be more concrete sequential. So my comfort level will be a good indicator for which learning strategies I employ. I could possibly see a shift as DBC progresses. It would be natural to feel a little uncomfortable during the first phase because everything is new; the environment, the people, the work. I will probably lean toward CS methods. But as the course moves on and I grow more comfortable with my peers and environment I will bounce back to more AR methods. Therefore I should be sure to give myself plenty of space and time to study alone while in phase 1 of the course. But not too much as I do want to get to know my classmates and instructors. The key will be how quickly I acclimate. I think pairing will definitely help me get to know people and I should try to pair with as many NYC boots as possible. Then once I gravitate to a more natural AR learning style I will focus on maintaining these relationships so I can work in an ideal environment.

    <p>The growth vs. fixed mindset debate focuses on whether or not intelligence and other attributes can be changed. I saw a lot of myself in the fixed mindset group. I tend to try to prove myself a lot, and will avoid challenges as they may be opportunities to fail. In order to become more growth oriented I can follow the four steps Dweck outlines in her book: learn to hear the fixed mindset "voice", recognize that I have a choice, assume a growth mindset attitude, and finally take the growth mindset action. If I do this I'm confident I can get out of the fixed mindset.
