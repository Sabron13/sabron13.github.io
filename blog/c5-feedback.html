    <p>Pairing can be hit and miss at times depending on who your partner is, if your personalities mesh, and your own state of mind. If I am frazzled, 
      distracted, and all over the place, I will probably be difficult to pair with. Usually I like to take a break an hour or so before the pairing session to unwind a little. Then I'll spend the rest of the time looking over the releases for the challenge. Then the fun begins.

    <p>I've genuinely had fun in some pairing sessions. Usually we were both focused on the challenge whiched helped us solve it without relative difficulty. Since I'm more reserved I usually pair better with someone who is more comfortable taking the lead. But I know I will not always find such ideal circumstances, so I have been practicing leading more when it is evident that I have more knowledge on the subject than they do. The tricky part, I find, is when we are both equally knowledgable on the subject. Then I feel like I'm trying not to step on their toes.

    <p>Funnily enough, I found giving feedback more difficult than the actual pairing. Maybe because I was too wrapped up in what I was doing rather than focusing on what my partner was doing. So recalling specifics on what they did was kind of hard. Also, when I have a pair that didn't put forth enough effort or made a mistake, I still think they will be able to tell it's me giving the feedback, even though I know it's anonymous. Weird. So overall I think I need to be less self-concious and more externally focused.

    <p>As for receiving feedback, it has been okay because it's mostly been positive so far. The main critcique I get is to be more vocal, which I agree with. Talking through a problem is a little foreign to me, since I'm usually working through this stuff myself. To improve this I think I'll try talking to myself as I work on a problem, especially when reading through code.
