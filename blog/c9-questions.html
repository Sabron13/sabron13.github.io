    <p><blockquote>"Hi everybody, so I'm stuck on the solo challenge for week-7. Basically, I want  to change the value of a property 
      from "closed" to "open" using a method. But when I try to check if it's opened in another method, the property has changed back to "closed". Is 
      there another way I can do this? By passing my first method into the second as a parameter, maybe?﻿"</blockquote>

    <p>This is a question I asked back in week 7. Looking back I don't think it's very clear what I am asking, hence the lack of answers. It would probably
      have been immediately obvious to many people had I included a snippet of code that contained my error. If I had put in my code I could have demonstrated my error as well, by putting in my method calls. Also, I refer to the value "open" as "opened" without quotes, which I think is confusing because it takes away the context that it's a value and uses it in a different tense.

    <p><blockquote>"has anyone else tried the DOM-manipulation in challenge 2? I put my JS in the js file, but It's not working. Here's an example of my JS:
<pre class="prettyprint"><code><\script>
document.getElementById("release-3").style.backgroundColor = #b163a3;
<\/script>

<\script>
document.getElementById("release-4").style.fontSize = 2em;
<\/script>
</code></pre>

What am I missing?﻿"</blockquote>
    </p>
    
    <p>This question is better because I included a bit of code, but I still didn't get a lot of answers that helped the specific problem, and that was my fault and not that of the posters. The problem was I didn't include the full code, part of which was causing the problems (thanks JavaScript). I did, though, identify it was JavaScript I was working on and even put that I had the code in my .js file despite the misleading html tags. On the other hand I wasn't very clear how the code was failing, I simply said "It's not working." Saying something like, "I don't see any changes in the html page when I load it in my browser," would have been more useful.
    </p>
    
    <p>Overall I think I could improve my questions by putting myself in the place of the answerer more. Supplying the correct and enough information is very important if I expect useful answers.
