    <p>Before I talk about cycle I want to talk about <i>enumerators</i> first. Enumerator is just a fancy word for something that can be counted.
      So arrays <pre class="prettyprint"><code>[1, 2, 3]</code></pre> and hashes <pre class="prettyprint"><code>{:one => 1, :two => 2, :three => 3}</code></pre> can be enumerators. Also ranges: <pre class="prettyprint"><code>0..5</code></pre>

    <p>So the cycle method is pretty much self explanatory. It will cycle through the enumerator until told to stop by an argument you supply in parentheses.
      Next is a code block that tells cycle what to do as it goes through the enumerator, which in this case tells it to return and print <i>x + 1</i> to the screen.
      <pre class="prettyprint"><code>
[1, 2, 3].cycle(3) { |x| p x + 1}
=> "2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4"</code></pre>
      
    </p>
    

    <p>You might have noticed that our little code's output did not increment upon itself. I mean we got "2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4" instead of "2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6". 
      That's because cycle saves the elements in an internal array so that they are not changed after the first cycle. Pretty neat!
