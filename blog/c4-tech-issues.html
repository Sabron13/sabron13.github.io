    <h2>1-18-2015</h2>
    <p>Their is no second guessing that the Tech industry is growing and fast. In the first half of 2014 alone it created over 100,000 new jobs. People in America are more
    reliant upon technology now than ever, what with wi-fi, smartphones, tablets, iCloud, and apps. Technology is everywhere and unavoidable. And with rapid and large advances in technology comes disparity among the people who create it and the people who use it. I'll admit that I'm more ignorant than knowledgable about technology. I don't really understand how the internet works. I understand that Ruby is a programming language, but what language is it written in? (C, it turns out. But what language is C written in? Is there a first language?) But I know there are some very smart people who know this stuff. And with their knowledge comes a mystique or aura about them and a divide can come between them, the gatekeepers, and the rest of us. This inequality can and often does lead to an ego-inflating pride that could push some people over the edge into madness.</p>

    <h3>Thinking technology can solve all the worlds problems.</h3>
    <p>Thiniking this is erroneous because the idea of a utopia, a world without problems, is just that: only an idea. The truth is as long as humans are using technology, there will be humans who abuse technology, thus causing problems. Drones fighting battles for us come to mind. Sure, it keeps our side safe, but at the cost of more enemy lives. And if at the end of the day, human life = human life, then we're really no better off with drones. Plus there is the videogame effect that the drone operators can get while killing actual people. It's to wonder how they can measure the value of life when they are so far removed from the actual act of killing.

	<h3>Thinking technology can give us superpowers.</h3>
    <p>Thinking this is just silly. Lumosity comes to mind, a website designed to make its users smarter just by playing games. From the Lumosity website, "Analysis of our database shows that just 10-15 minutes of Lumosity training per day can lead to improvements in Lumosity over time." Great, now I can signal intelligence with my Lumosity score, and never mind doing any actual learning. Thanks Lumosity!

    <p>The pitfall of pride is everywhere. What makes technology potentially insidious is the amazing things we can do with it. The more amazing the more we put it on a pedastal. But we have to remember that at its root technology is just a set of tools. They may be sophisticated, shiny, and sleek, but they are just tools for us to use to meet our goals. I think one way to demystify technology is to learn more about it. The more we know about it and understand how it works, the less "magic" we see in it. It becomes more real and less ideal.
