      My girlfriend, Jen, plays the violin in a band. She complains that while rehearsing she'll improvise something she really likes, and then it's gone, wiped from her memory and never to be reproduced again. But, if they had been recording their session, a new version of the song would exist with her improvised part. This is the essence of version control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Version control is like creating checkpoints along the way while you're creating something. If the band practiced a song a bunch of times, they would have multiple recordings at hand. They could cut and edit the songs in numerous ways to make even more versions of the song. They would simply save each version they liked with their software. In developing, git is that software.

      Git is a tool developers use to implement version control. With a simple status check from git you can see all the files you have modified. Decide against a change? Git will allow you to make some changes permanent, while not making others so. And even when the changes are permanent, places like GitHub keep a log of all the changes you've made; what you've added, what's been deleted, etc.

      Say Jen's band mates were living half way around the world in Korea (two of them are, no for real!), and both sides want to work on a song they wrote. Well, a master copy posted online would be handy. That's GitHub: a place online to keep your collaborative work. Like I already said, it keeps a log of all changes so you can revert back to a previous working version should need be. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      So what did we learn? Version control is creating and saving different versions of your work like checkpoints. Git is used to do this and has many amazing features. And GitHub is a place that hosts your work.
