        <h3>What is pair programming?</h3>
        <p>Pair programming is a collaborative way of writing code.  Teamwork is paramount. The positives for pair coding are: more robust code, partners can fill in each other's gaps in knowledge, more attention to detail. </p>

        <h3>Why is pair programming important?</h3>
        <p>Programming is making a footprint in sectors that it never has before including education, healthcare, and journalism. 
            Understanding the client, their needs, as well as creating a sustainable design this is where pair programming can allow 
            coders to conversate more about their products, flush out better design, and develop products that speak to their end user 
            more closely. Also, pair programming allows for mentorship and team collaboration in a world where developers are not always 
            sitting side by side (e.g. telecommuting!).

        <h3>Driver &amp; Navigator</h3>
        <p>The Driver sits at the terminal hacking away, while the navigator will steer the course of the program. A good driver listens to their navigator, but there is also give and take. The navigator keeps the big picture in mind while giving good directions.</p>
